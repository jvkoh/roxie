          <strong>Roxie Darling</strong> has been changing hair since 2006. After years at prestigious New York City salons Bumble &amp; Bumble and Cutler, she now works out of her private studio in Chelsea. <strong>Roxieâ€™s color transformations</strong> can be found in major fashion campaigns and on the red carpet, but she is proud of her diverse clientele: <strong>the people who make up New York</strong>&ndash;from gallery owners to school teachers. A painter and textile dyer, Roxie is a creative director and brand ambassador at NYC-based startup Hairstory; she also teaches hair color theory to hairdressers all over the country. She is currently working on an art project-turned-book on the <strong>psychology of color through the medium of hair</strong>.
