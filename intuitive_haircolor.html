          What is holding you back from living your best life?<br/>
          How can you change your outlook and bring out your magic every day so you can live your absolute truth?
        </p>

        <p>
          Intuitive haircolor is a transformative process that combines hair color transmutation with energetic light work on the mind and physical body.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you set an intention behind transforming your haircolor, it can be an incredibly healing process and a very effective way to bring about changes in your life with very tangible results.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you arrive for your color healing session, we will embark on a journey together, starting with an in-depth conversation about the shifts you want to see in your life. I use my intuition and my education and experience as a master colorist and healer to propose hair color changes that best suit you. These changes will add magic to your every day, make space for big changes to come, or balance your own energies and the influence of energies around you.
        </p>

        <p>
          After our in-depth consultation about the changes I will help facilitate in your life, I will assess your energetic body and start the hair color process. while I work to physically change your hair color. I will be asking you about the messages I receive intuitively from your energy facilitating a conversation about the changes that need to happen. My intuition is also bolstered by the use of oracle cards and reiki energy (the ancient technique of channeling life force energy through my hands), crystals and essential oils. Then every time you see yourself with your new hair color, you will be reminded of the intention that you have set to live with more magic in your life.
        </p>

        <p>
          I will also help you discover who your shamanic spirit animal guide is and you will take them with you on your journey even after our session. You will also leave with a mantra to equip you to go into the world and manifest your dreams and desires.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the changes you seek need to happen over time, intuitive hair color sessions can take place over a 3 month period or in an intense session over the course of an entire day. It is important to remember that this process is a conversation and will be tailored to your comforts and personal goals.
